# Hybrid network with AWS Transit Gateway
An [Amazon SageMaker notebook instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html) is a machine learning (ML) compute instance running the Jupyter Notebook App. SageMaker manages creating the instance and related resources. Use Jupyter notebooks in your notebook instance to prepare and process data, write code to train models, deploy models to SageMaker hosting, and test or validate your models.

## How Are Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks Different from Notebook Instances?
When you're starting a new notebook, we recommend that you create the notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio instead of launching a notebook instance from the Amazon SageMaker console. There are many benefits to using a SageMaker Studio notebook, including the following:
- Starting a Studio notebook is faster than launching an instance-based notebook. Typically, it is 5-10 times faster than instance-based notebooks. 
- Notebook sharing is an integrated feature in SageMaker Studio. Users can generate a shareable link that reproduces the notebook code and also the SageMaker image required to execute it, in just a few clicks.
- SageMaker Studio notebooks come pre-installed with the latest Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.
- SageMaker Studio notebooks are accessed from within Studio. This enables you to build, train, debug, track, and monitor your models without leaving Studio.

## Setup
[This](https://github.com/Young-ook/terraform-aws-sagemaker/blob/main/examples/isolated-network/main.tf) is the example of terraform configuration file to create an SageMaker notebook instance in isolated network. Check out and apply it using terraform command.

First we have to create two VPCs. One is an isolated vpc to place the sagemaker notebook instance, and the other is a control tower vpc to simulate a corporate data center.

Run terraform:
```
terraform init
terraform apply -target module.vpc -target module.corp
```
Also you can use the `-var-file` option for customized paramters when you run the terraform plan/apply command.
```
terraform plan -var-file tc1.tfvars -target module.vpc -target module.corp
terraform apply -var-file tc1.tfvars -target module.vpc -target module.corp
```

Run terraform to create other resources:
```
terraform apply
```

## Clean up
Run terraform:
```
terraform destroy
```
Don't forget you have to use the `-var-file` option when you run terraform destroy command to delete the aws resources created with extra variable files.
```
terraform destroy -var-file tc1.tfvars
```
